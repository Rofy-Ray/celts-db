# celts-db

This is a project for Database Systems (CSC 330) in the Fall 2018 semester to build a database system for CELTS on Berea College campus!

The database system is to help the center better manage the services and opportunities it provides to the campus and surrounding community at large by merging formal education with service work and volunteering.

The present model of this database system was designed with the administrator in mind and so the processes and capabilities that the system currently has are meant for the administrator(s) of the system.

The current model allows basic functionality such as adding, editing, and deleting people along with key information in the different groups specified (Involvement section). It is important to also note that only three groups currently have interaction - Student Labor Staff, Staff and Student Volunteer.

# The two editors - Event & Announcement - in the admin dashboard also do not submit entered data.

Steps:

1. If you have already signed up in the system before, you can go ahead and login once you come to this page (as the login page serves as the homepage). 
2. If you do not have login info, hit the "Signup Now!" link and you will be redirected to a signup form to enter some details and get added to the system. You will see a success message if you signup correctly. You can then head back to the login page to login and explore the system.

The database system has been currently deployed on a tango server (owned by the Berea College CS Dep't for coursework).

Have fun checking out this database system.

# This database system model has a lot of potential and there are more features that can be implemented and added later on.

# A manual (for both user and programmer) is also available upon request that walks a user through the different functionalities of the system.
